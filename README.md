The remoteAPI.dll is currently set to work for windows, I will update this later on for linux.
Many of the python files in the api folder were imported from the simulator, here is a list of ones I have created and wrote into: 
dqn.py
environment.py
joint_controll.py
main.py
state_retrieval.py
test_connection.py
