The remoteAPI.dll is currently set to work for windows, I will update this later on for linux. 

Many of the python files in the api folder were imported from the simulator, here is a list of ones I have created and wrote into: <br />

dqn.py<br />

environment.py<br />

joint_controll.py<br />

main.py<br />

state_retrieval.py<br />

test_connection.py
